for x in range(4): # This is the outer loop
  for y in range(3): #This is the inner loop
    print(f'({x},{y})')
    # So in the above, the outer loop with print once, and then the inner loop will print its full amount
    # this will happen depending on how many outer loops there are. 
    # so since there is 4 outer and 3 inner. it will go: 1 outer 3 inner and then repeat that four times.
